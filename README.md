# Picross_Java_Gui

 This is my java projet for school. The purpose is to make a java picross with many lvls and a lvl editor and maby differents theme if i can and have the time !
 It work with jkd 11 and 14 (I didn't test with older versions)

## Functionnalities

 * A playable picross game
 * level editor

## Difficulties

  There are 3 levels of difficulty :

  * Easy
  * Medium
  * Hard

  The concept of difficulty is based on the size of the grid
  Easy mode is 10 by 10
  Medium is 15 by 15
  Hard is 20 by 20

## Color themes

  The choice of the color theme is not yet implemented

## Level editor

  You can chose the difficulty (the size) of the grid
  and then create your beautiful black and white pixel
  art and name it how ever you want
